# WebAssembly Files

This directory should contain the WebAssembly files compiled from llama.cpp:

- `llama-wasm.js`: The JavaScript glue code generated by Emscripten
- `llama-wasm.wasm`: The WebAssembly binary file

## Building the WebAssembly Files

You can build these files using the provided `build-wasm.sh` script in the root directory:

```bash
./build-wasm.sh
```

This script will:
1. Clone the llama.cpp repository
2. Configure it for WebAssembly compilation
3. Build the WebAssembly files
4. Copy them to this directory

## Manual Building

If you prefer to build manually, follow these steps:

1. Install Emscripten SDK
2. Clone llama.cpp
3. Follow the instructions in `/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Copy the resulting files to this directory

## Demo Mode

If the WebAssembly files aren't available, the application will automatically run in "demo mode" using simulated responses.

You can also force demo mode by adding `?demo=true` to the URL.
